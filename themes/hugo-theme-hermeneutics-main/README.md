Hermeneutics, a Hugo theme, built **from scratch** by me and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) in about 25 hours.

## Origin of the Name

The name comes from a song I really love. You can find the original video [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18S4y1v7gV/).

This theme doesn't have much to do with the religious or philosophical meaning of "hermeneutics", so you don't have to expect its style to match your first impression of the word.

## Features

- Highly native (only uses UnoCSS in theme dev)
- Extremely beautiful interface and animations (at least in my opinion)
- Fully responsive
- Rich shortcodes and additional features:
    - Atom Feed and JSON Feed
    - Obsidian Style Wiki Links (`[[Link|Display]]`) (Markdown file only)
    - LaTeX support
    - GitHub Alert support for native Markdown
    - Announcement feature
    - Comment support (currently supports [Twikoo](https://twikoo.js.org) and [Artalk](https://artalk.js.org))
    - Algolia Docsearch / PageFind
    - bilibili video card support (note: not a player)
    - GitHub / GitLab / Gitea / Forgejo card support
    - Gallery
    - Pure native JavaScript image lightbox
    - Wowbook word count
    - Shiki code highlighting (optional, requires configuration)

## WIP (Work in Progress)

- [ ] Support for more commenting systems
- [ ] Comprehensive, CJK-friendly search functionality
- [ ] Refactor code for consistent code style
- [ ] Further SEO optimization
- [ ] Theme documentation

## Disclaimer

The original intention of this theme was to create a self-use theme according to my own aesthetics. Due to its extremely radical development strategy, the code style and structure may not be satisfactory. If you wish to use or contribute, it's sincerely welcomed‚ÄîI'll do my best to help, but can't guarantee the results.  

## Acknowledgements

- The theme's design draws heavily from [ÁôΩ„ÅÑ](https://innei.in). Many thanks to Innei for his brilliant design and aesthetics. "ÁôΩ„ÅÑ" is closed-source, and I did not refer to any code from its open-source version, [Shiro](https://github.com/innei/Shiro). Therefore, I believe this theme is not subject to the "copyleft" provisions of Shiro's AGPLv3 license.
- Code completion and project construction relied on Cursor.
- `twikoo.css` references some styles from [AnZhiYu](https://github.com/anzhiyu-c/hexo-theme-anzhiyu).
